Force and distance elastic deformation curve is storing the energy that youre putting into it(in this case a paperclip) and its going right back to where its supposed to be.

Bending a little to far(permanently deformed= plastic deformation)
different materials have different elastic and plastic curves. e.g input force and then where does the it belong in the curve?


Note that:
the graph just stretch out to infinity. 

you have to factor in the failure. the sweet spot



Issues:
you have to be deep in the Fracture mechanics
